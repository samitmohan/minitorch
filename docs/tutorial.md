# Tutorial & Use Cases

## Regression Demo

Learn a simple linear relationship y = 2x + 1:

```bash
python train.py
```

This runs 100 epochs on synthetic data and plots training loss.

## Benchmarking

Compare MiniTorch performance to NumPy and PyTorch:

```bash
python benchmark.py
```

See timing output in the console.
